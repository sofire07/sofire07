I'm Chris Sophiea. I graduated from Arizona State University in May of 2020 with a degree in Applied Computing. At ASU I built a solid foundation in object-oriented programming, database development and web development. Since becoming an associate with Revature, I've worked on a few full-stack .NET projects, including a video-game store using ASP.NET MVC, a social media web-site for space fans using ASP.NET Web APIs and an Angular front-End, and the last project was a little-league team management studio using an Angular front-end and ASP.NET API microservices in the back-end.</p>
